# m-seas-projD


This is my first attempt at using GIT and GITHUB for my 3rd year project. I will attempt to upload my
R code here so I can track versions and store it and stuff.

There will be errors, but I will figure it out eventually.


First update: I was finally able to push the file on my computer to github! It looks weird as the README, 
buy maybe that's something I need to remember how to fix with html stuff?
